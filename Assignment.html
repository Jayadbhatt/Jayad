      <h1>2. • How to embed audio and video in a webpage?  </h1>
      <p> Ans= To embed audio and video in a webpage, you can use HTML5's AUDIO and VIDEO elements. Here's a basic example for both:</p>
      <p> For Audio: 
        <audio controls >
            <source src="your-audio-file.mp3" type="audio/mp3"></audio>
            <p>Your browser does not support the Audio tag.</p>

 
      <p>For Video:
        <video width="640" height="360" controls>
            <source src="your-video-file.mp4" type="video/mp4">
            <p>Your browser does not support the Audio tag.</p>
        </video>
      </p>
      <p>Replace you audio-file.mp3 and you-video-file.mp4 with the actual file path or urls. The controls attribute adds play, pause, and volume controls.</p>

      <h1> 3 • Semantic element in HTML5? </h1>
      <p> Ans. Semantic elements in HTML5 are tags that carry meaning about the structure and content of the document, making it more understandable for both browsers and developers. Some examples include <br> header,<br> <br>nav <br>,<br> article <br>, <br>section,<br>footer <br>, and <br> aside <br>. Using these elements appropriately improves the document's accessibility, SEO, and overall structure.</p>

    <h1> 4 • Canvas and SVG tags
    </h1>
  
    <p>Ans== Both canvas and svg are HTML elements used for rendering graphics, but they have different approaches.</p>
          <p>.CANVAS(<canvas>): </p>
          <p>. Provides a bitmap-based driving surface. </p>
          <p>. Uses JavaScript to draw shapes, images, and complex graphics.</p>
          <p>. Well- suited for dynamic and interactive graphics.</p>
          <p>. Resolution- dependent, so scaling might affect quality.</p>
          <h3> EXAMPLE..</h3>
           <canvas id="myCanvas" width="200" height="100"></canvas>
           <script>
            var canvas= document.getElementById('myCanvas');
            var context= canvas.getContext('2d');
            context.fillstyle= 'blue';
            context.fillRect(10, 10, 150, 80);
           </script>

           <h3> .SVG(<svg>) </h3>
            <p>. Defines graphics in XML format.</p>
            <p>. Each graphic element is an XML tag.</p>
            <p>. Retains  crisp quality regardlese of scaling.</p>
            <p>. Well-suited for staic or less complex graphics.</p>
            <h4>EXAMPLE</h4>
            <svg width="200" height="100">
              <rect width="150" height="80" style="fill:blue;"/></svg>

             <h3> Comparison of Canvas and SVG</h3>
The table below shows some important differences between Canvas and SVG:

<h4>.Canvas</h4>	
<p>Resolution dependent</p>
<p>No support for event handlers</p>
<p>Poor text rendering capabilities</p>
<p>You can save the resulting image as .png or .jpg</p>
<p>Well suited for graphic-intensive games</p>

<h4>.SVG </h4>
<p>Resolution independent</p>
<p>Support for event handlers</p>
<p>Best suited for applications with large rendering areas (Google Maps)</p>
<p>Slow rendering if complex (anything that uses the DOM a lot will be slow)</p>
<p>Not suited for game applications</p>
